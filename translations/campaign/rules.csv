A new range of mountains rises on the horizon, torn in half by catastrophic workings of the terraformers, and beyond is a chaos of steep valleys populated by dwarf pine and thin white waterfalls.

The man - Mister Loke you presume - smiles blandly and says ""I will show the captain the way.""

Loke simply stops paying attention to the clerk, shifting his attention to you, still smiling. He nods encouragingly and turns to walk into the darkness beyond the portal.",
gaKANewMaxiosVisit2.text,"Mister Loke leads you past rows of sealed storage units, into a loading bay. Your footsteps produce a dull metallic echo. Something that smells of organic compounds is leaking.

His watery eyes stare at the storage unit, ""It must be a nice thing.""",
gaKANewMaxiosVisit3.text,"Instead of answering, he gives you a respectful nod, and says ""Goodbye,"" then walks away into the shadows of the warehouse.

The entire crew of technicians take an unconscious step back. Hyperwave phasing technology has a poor reputation. And it's never been known to fit in so small a package and remain stable.

An hour later, as you are finishing your second hot drink at a nearby cafe, the techs give the all-clear through your datapad, concluding that as strange as this device is - seemingly a hand-built one-off hyperwave transmitter of some kind - it should pose no immediate danger.

You order it removed to your flagship.",
gaKANewMaxiosVisit5.text,"On the shuttle ride back to your $shipOrFleet you ponder tactics for inserting this device into the Aztlan Hyperwave Relay without being spotted by a Hegemony patrol.

Cyclopean arcology substructure flashes by as you ride the primary ring tube to a far segment of the metroplex; a small passenger lift fills with the smell of sweat and machine oil of a shift of undersea laborers returning home; glimpses of the towering arms of Kay-arco flash by, glittering with thousands of windows.

She admires your uniform, ""Are you also from Fleet?""

You manage to avoid answering that question; Adonya has a holo-feed of the King of Westernesse holding court set to half-volume and switches effortlessly between commenting on the proceedings and questioning you about personal matters: you hedge on your precise age, admit to operating a space $shipOrFleet, and leave your marital status vague. She doesn't seem to mind your non-answers.

Adonya looks disappointed, and mutters ""Stupid thing."" She looks at you again, ""Do you need more tea, dear?""

Banks of windows and balconies flow across the facing towers. Drones buzz in ordered lines, diverting to deliver packages or attend to cleaning. Adonya explains the generous terms of her lease compared to those offered by other towers and asks if you've considered retiring to Fikenhild.
